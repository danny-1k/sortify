# Sortify
Automatically sort songs in a spotify playlist by their similarity to produce a playlist where transition to different songs arent random.

[I once made a playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4tOZWb7Gx46PSECRhNVm8P) for my friends and I but the order of songs were quite random, to me, this kindof tampered with the listening experience. Manually ordering the songs proved tedious *(ahem, I'm Lazy)*.
